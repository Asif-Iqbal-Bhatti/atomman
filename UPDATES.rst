Updates
=======

Version 1.2.4
-------------

- **Atoms.prop_atype()** added to allow properties to be assigned by prop_atype.

- **ElasticConstants.normalized_as()** and **ElasticConstants.is_normal()** added to
  force/check crystallographic symmetry of elastic tensors.

- **load('atom_data')** updated to support reading files containing # comments.

- **lammps.Potential** now supports specifying potentials with static charges.

- **defect.IsotropicVolterraDislocation** class added as **defect.Stroh** could not calculate
  isotropic solutions. Both classes are now children of **defect.VolterraDislocation**,
  and wrapper function **defect.solve_volterra_dislocation()** has been added.

- **defect.dislocation_array()** added that transforms a bulk system into a periodic array of
  dislocations, where the two system boundaries in the slip plane are periodic, and
  the third boundary is not.

- **defect.differential_displacement()** updated to provide users more options and control over
  the plots.

- MANIFEST.in corrected so non-code files should be properly copied during installation.

Version 1.2.3
-------------

- **load()** updated with more uniform parameters across the different styles.  
  Style 'phonopy_Atoms' added.

- **System.wrap()** made slightly more robust.

Version 1.2.2
-------------
- **System** scale/unscale bug fix.

- **defect.GammaSurface.model()** returned format improved for saving/loading results.

- **load('system_model')** updated with symbols parameter.

Version 1.2.1
-------------

- Corrections to setup.py for properly loading/building cython code.

Version 1.2.0
-------------

- Overhaul for Python 2/3 compatibility.

- Reorganization of code and renaming of some features.

- Cython routines added for dvect and neighbor list calculations.

- Improved documentation.
